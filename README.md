# Movie-Sentiment-Review

Project Overview

In this project, we delve into Natural Language Processing (NLP) by constructing a deep learning model tailored for sentiment analysis. The primary objective is to develop a robust Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) capable of effectively analyzing and classifying the sentiment conveyed in movie reviews. This project offers a hands-on experience in critical NLP tasks such as text preprocessing, RNN architecture design, model training, and performance evaluation.
Dataset Selection

For this project, a suitable dataset for sentiment analysis was chosen. The IMDB movie reviews dataset, renowned for its extensive collection of labeled reviews, was selected as the primary dataset. This dataset provides a balanced distribution of positive and negative sentiments, offering an ideal foundation for training and testing the sentiment analysis model.
Text Preprocessing

The text data underwent a meticulous preprocessing phase, involving tokenization, removal of stop words, and addressing issues such as punctuation and capitalization. The dataset was then effectively split into training and testing sets, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance.
RNN Architecture Design

The core of the project involved designing an RNN architecture for sentiment analysis. Various architectures were experimented with, including different layer configurations, types of recurrent layers, and activation functions. This exploration aimed to identify the most effective configuration for discerning sentiment in movie reviews.
Model Training

The RNN model was trained using the designated training dataset. Hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and epochs were subject to experimentation. The training process was closely monitored, and trends in loss and accuracy were analyzed to gauge the model's learning progress.
Model Evaluation

The trained model underwent thorough evaluation using the testing dataset. Key metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, were calculated to assess the model's overall performance. Misclassifications were scrutinized to identify specific areas for improvement.
Model Fine-Tuning and Optimization

To enhance performance, various model fine-tuning and optimization techniques were explored. Dropout, bidirectional RNNs, and adjustments to the model architecture were considered and implemented to refine the sentiment analysis model.
Integration of Pre-trained Word Embeddings

In further experimentation, pre-trained word embeddings, such as Word2Vec and GloVe, were integrated into the model. The results were compared with the initial model to determine the impact of leveraging pre-trained embeddings on sentiment analysis accuracy.

This project provides a comprehensive exploration of sentiment analysis using deep learning techniques, offering valuable insights into the nuances of natural language processing. Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different configurations to enhance the model's performance.
